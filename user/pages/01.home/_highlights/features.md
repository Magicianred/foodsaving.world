## Welcome

You just arrived at the home of the **global and distributed** movement against food waste.</br>
Our main method is to **save food from being thrown away**.</br>
This is done via **cooperations with stores** restaurants and any kind of business, that handles food.

#### **We want to help you be part of it!**
