<h3>Let's get organized!</h3>

<em>We develop free and open source software for you to organize your pick-ups!</em>

<div align="left">
<p>The core piece of our work is a tool, that is meant to enable you to run a successful, efficient and organized foodsaving
  project. It is a
  <strong>completely translatable, open source and free</strong> piece of software, that is developed by passionate volunteers only.
  </p>

<p>We host an instance of it right here on foodsaving.world and you can try it out as much as you like. The general idea for
  long-term use however is, that foodsaving groups host their own instances if possible. </p>

<p>
  <i>You're very welcome to
    <a href="https://github.com/yunity/karrot-frontend">visit our project on GitHub</a> if you want to have a closer look at the code.</i>
</p>

<p>These are just some of the benefits you'll experience when deciding to use Karrot for your foodsaving group:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Less confusion</strong>
    <br> All the relevant info of a store can be entered on the store page. General group info can be entered on the group page
    and every single foodsaver has a profile, in which info can be entered.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>More overview</strong>
    <br> You have a map of where the stores and the people doing the pick-ups are located. You have a nice list of upcoming pick-ups
    and can sign up for them online.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Record of past events</strong>
    <br> The history shows who did what and when. If a pick-up was missed you can see who to yell at... ;)</li>
  <li>Karrot is
    <strong>fully translatable</strong> by the community and many languages are already added. To contribute more translations just
    <a href="https://www.transifex.com/yunity-1/karrot/" target="_blank">visit the project on transifex</a>.</li>
  <li>Since Karrot is
    <strong>open source</strong> we encourage groups to host their own instances of the platform, if they have the ability to do
    so. Still, we also provide access to a hosted version here on foodsaving.world.
