For the sharing part facebook or other social media can be pretty useful, since it is easy to reach a lot of people as soon as the group is slightly known by local folks. But especially the saving part is hard to organize via classic social networks. That's why we started developing **[Karrot](/karrot)**. It's a software inspired by German <a href="https://foodsharing.de/" target="_blank">foodsharing.de</a>. With it you have a dedicated software that can be used on desktop as well as on mobile. You can create a digital model of your real-life group, its people and cooperating businesses and you'll never lose the overview again. **And using it is completely free of charge!**
