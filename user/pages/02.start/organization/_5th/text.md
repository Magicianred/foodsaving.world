For the sharing part facebook or other social media can be pretty useful, since it is easy to reach a lot of people as soon as the group is slightly known by local folks. But especially the saving part is hard to organize via classic social networks. That's why we started developing **[Karrot](/karrot)**. It's a software inspired by German <a href="https://foodsharing.de/" target="_blank">foodsharing.de</a>. With it you have:

- password protected groups
- user accounts with profile information and picture
- store pages with description and location
- map to display store locations
- individual or recurring pickup dates
- notification mails
- group wall with emoji reactions
- full translation support via transifex
- activity history for full transparency
- pickup feedback option
* **a lot more in the future!** _Karrot is under active development_
