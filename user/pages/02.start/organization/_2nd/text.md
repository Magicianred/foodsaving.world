## <div class="fa fa-briefcase"></div> _Building sustainable relationships with stores_
Make sure you have enough volunteers to back up the daily pick-ups! It is important that the store considers your group as reliable, and that you keep on delivering on what you promised instead of making them wait for people who do not show up.

<a href="https://yunity.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/FSINT/pages/46203075/How+to+build+and+maintain+cooperations+with+stores" target="_blank">Here is a small manual</a> on how to give businesses a good first impression, an appealing second one and make the third irresistible!

A real kick-off would be the participation of a whole branch of supermarkets. You would need to address the key account manager of this chain and not simply the local management team. Feel free to use <a href="https://yunity.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/FSINT/pages/93497044/Example+letter+to+a+chain+HQ" target="_blank">this example letter</a> and adapt it to your case as much as needed. Our recommendation would be to designate one person from your group who would be accountable for communicating with this chain's stores. This way, communication is more efficient and you generate trust, because this one person is able to keep the overview and consistently represent your initiative towards the chain.
