## <div class="fa fa-arrows-alt"></div> _Dare to think big!_

A real kick-off would be the participation of a whole branch of supermarkets. You would need to address the key account manager of this chain and not simply the local management team. Feel free to use <a href="https://community.foodsaving.world/t/template-text-letter-to-s-chain-hq/69" target="_blank">this example letter</a> and adapt it to your case as much as needed. Our recommendation would be to designate one person from your group who would be accountable for communicating with this chain's stores. This way, communication is more efficient and you generate trust, because this one person is able to keep the overview and consistently represent your initiative towards the chain.
