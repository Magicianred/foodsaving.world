### <div class="fa fa-laptop"></div> _There's people on the internet_

When starting to reach out and organize it can make sense to directly bring people together on an online platform. [**Karrot**](/karrot) is the software we created for you to administrate your pickups. But it's far more than that! You can gather people in a custom group for your city way before you have your first cooperation, so that they are already there, when the time has come to really get started. </br>
Karrot lets you protect your group via password. This way you are free to implement whatever process you deem useful before giving out the password to new foodsavers. Really, we encourage you to be creative, to think outside the box and come up with the best solution for your specific group! Feel free to get inspiration from others or come up with a whole new system. In the latter case, please let us know how it's working!
