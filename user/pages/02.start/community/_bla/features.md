### <div class="fa fa-arrow-right"></div> _Come gather 'round, people_

Remember that the most important part of a sharing community is a community! Before you can actually start with any foodsaving, you will need to build up a reliable network of foodsavers. There is a lot of food to be eaten! So gather your trustworthy, dedicated friends and then reach out to local strangers and invite them to save food. Start an awareness raising campaign to get them on board:
* contact the existing alternative infrastructure like student committees, green offices, housing projects etc.
* publish an article in a local newspaper or give an interview on local radio
* get super active on social media to reach out even further
* organize info events and tell people about your plans
