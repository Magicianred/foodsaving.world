## <div class="fa fa-female"></div> _Friendly, connected and professional_

For some behavioral standards example, please refer to the checklist 'Professionalism for foodsavers' within the <a href="https://yunity.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/FSINT/pages/46203075/How+to+build+and+maintain+cooperations+with+stores" target="_blank">cooperation mini manual</a>.

However you choose to work together, the most important thing is, that you _do_. To make that possible it's important to stay in contact and to know where the other foodsavers are located. Karrot provide's a map feature that gives a nice overview, if everybody signs up and enters their contact and location data. That way you have a nice overview of who can help out where and in which parts of your area it makes sense to look for more cooperation partners. If for some reason Karrot doesn't work for you, you should still try to keep a secure database of your members with contacts and addresses, respectful of data privacy and protection laws.
