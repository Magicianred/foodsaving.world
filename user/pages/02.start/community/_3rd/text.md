## <div class="fa fa-handshake-o"></div> _Together we are strong_

There are many activities that can be set up to get to know each other and create bonds. Here are some ideas of events that we found relevant, fun, easy to organize and engaging:

* <a href="https://community.foodsaving.world/t/guide-food-share-point-mini-manual/56/1" target="_blank">Food-Share Point</a> construction workshop: if you want to set up a location where people can share food unconditionally, this can be a wonderful activity for members to connect.
* <a href="https://community.foodsaving.world/t/guide-how-to-hold-a-foodsharing-brunch/59/1" target="_blank">Brunch with saved food</a>: if Sunday brunch is a thing in your town, there will surely be open-brunch caf√©s and restaurants who usually have a lot of yummy leftovers that can be saved. Get in touch with them, bring a lot of containers, from small to big, and save it! If you have access to a location nearby like a neighborhood center, a foodsaver's living room or a park in the warmer days, you can invite your whole community to join for a late and sustainable Sunday brunch :)
* <a href="https://community.foodsaving.world/t/guide-foodsaving-at-festivals/61/1" target="_blank">Saving at festivals</a>: Music festivals are a great saving opportunity, not only for food but for various items people leave behind there. It also is fun to go to a festival with your friends! So why not combine the two?

Of course it is as important to keep the people around as gathering them, so be sure to be nice to each other! If there are some who don't get what this means, you may want to refer to more clearly formulated criteria. In that case have a look at our <a href="https://community.foodsaving.world/t/guideline-for-positive-cooperation/68" target="_blank">guideline for positive cooperation</a> (among the team members, in this case).
