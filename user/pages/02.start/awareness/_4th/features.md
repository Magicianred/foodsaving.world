You could also run an awareness rising campaign among politicians and other public players. <br>
For instance, over the course of 2015 and 2016 <a href="https://foodsharing.de" target="_blank">foodsharing.de</a> has actively participated in the <a href="http://www.leeretonne.de/" target="_blank">Leere Tonne</a> ("Empty bins") campaign, using a petition to ask the German government to adopt a similar law as the one voted for in the French Parliament in spring 2016, which forces supermarkets to donate their surplus food instead of throwing it away. <br>
Food waste is becoming a more and more prominent topic in public discourse, so there are already public programmes - like the European <a href="http://eu-refresh.org/" target="_blank">Refresh program</a> - , with which you could connect to support each other. Keep in mind though that, as far as political parties are concerned, foodsharing stays as neutral as possible.
