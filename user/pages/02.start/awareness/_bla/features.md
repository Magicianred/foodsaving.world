### <div class="fa fa-bullhorn"></div> _Promote the good cause_
Most importantly: _Don't use the "free of cost" incentive!_ <br>
Foodsaving isn't about promoting access to free food, it's about fighting a waste-system that we disagree with. Make a clear statement and don't let people assume that you are bunch of cheap garbage-hungry humans. What you are doing is amazing and you know it!

The fact that your community exists already gets a lot of attention and raises awareness. Don't be shy! Get people to talk about it; share food, love and awareness!
