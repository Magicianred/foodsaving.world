## <div class="fa fa-cutlery"></div> _Events that spark interest_
There are many possibilities to get people's interest up: Events like <a href="http://now-here-this.timeout.com/2015/03/01/eat-to-the-beat-disco-soup-are-turning-food-waste-into-party-fuel/" target="_blank">disco soups</a> or pop-up <a href="https://community.foodsaving.world/t/guide-food-share-point-mini-manual/56/1" target="_blank">Food-Share Points</a>, where saved food gets distributed to the people, always get a lot of attention.

Or you make use of <a href="https://feedbackglobal.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/F5K-The-Introductory-Toolkit-1.pdf" target="_blank">Feedback Global's toolkit</a> and organize a <a href="https://feedbackglobal.org/campaigns/feeding-the-5000/" target="_blank">Feeding the 5000</a> event. That's _definitely_ gonna get you that press you need! And on top of that it's fun and a great opportunity to get to know more like-minded people!
