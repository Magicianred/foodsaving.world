It's important to point out that this way of fighting food waste is still pretty new and there is no perfect legal framework that has rules and regulations for every possible scenario, so there is some tiny risk to it. But if people get food poisoning, then they would need to prove that it was because of the food that you saved to be able to come back at you - something that is rather hard to do... So our recommendation is to not take this too seriously, to get the support from some city officials and make sure that your operations run smoothly and that your Food-Share Points are clean. Then everything should be fine.
